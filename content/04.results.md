### Re-identifying the mutator allele on chromosome 4 in the BXDs

We first applied our inter-haplotype distance method to 94 BXD RILs [Methods] using the previously described *de novo* germline mutation data [@PMID:35545679]. Reassuringly, we observed a large peak in cosine distance at a locus on chromosome 4 (Figure {@fig:figure-two}A; maximum distance of X at marker ID rsYYYYY; position 116.8 Mbp in mm10 coordinates).

Distance thresholds at $p = 0.2$ and $p = 0.05$ were calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD haplotype mutation data.](images/Figure%202.svg){#fig:figure-two width=8in .white} 

In a previous analysis, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify a nearly identical locus on chromosome 4 that was significantly associated with the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. This locus overlaps 21 protein-coding genes that are annotated by the Gene Ontology as being involved in "DNA repair," but only one of these genes contains non-synonymous differences between the two parental strains: *Mutyh*. *Mutyh* encodes a protein involved in the base-excision repair of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a DNA lesion caused by oxidative damage, and prevents the accumulation of C>A mutations following DNA replication. As expected, C>A germline mutation rates are nearly 50% higher in BXDs that inherited *D* haplotypes at marker ID rsYYYY than in those that inherited *B* haplotypes.

### An additional germline mutator allele on chromosome 6

After confirming that the inter-haplotype distance method could recover the mutator locus overlapping *Mutyh*, we asked if our approach could identify additional mutator loci in the BXD. To account for the effects of the C>A germline mutator locus near *Mutyh*, we divided the BXD RILs into those with either *D* (n = X) or *B* (n = Y) genotypes at rsYYYYY (the peak marker on chromosome 4), and ran a genome-wide distance scan using each group separately (Figure {@fig:figure-two}B.

Using only the BXDs with *B* haplotypes at the *Mutyh* mutator locus, we did not observe any genome-wide significant peaks. But using the BXDs with *D* haplotypes at the same locus, we identified a cosine distance peak on chromosome 6 ((Figure {@fig:figure-two}B; maximum distance of X at marker rsYYYYY; position 133.2 Mbp in mm10 coordinates). We queried the region underneath this peak and discovered two genes annotated with the Gene Ontology term "DNA repair": *Setmar*, a protein with histone methyltransferase and transposase activity, and remarkably, *Ogg1*. The latter encodes a key member of the base-exision repair response to oxidative DNA damage, a pathway that also includes *Mutyh* and a related gene, *Mth1*. Both *Setmar* and *Ogg1* harbor nonsynonymous differences between *D* and *B* haplotypes (@tbl:table-one).

### Evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles

We next compared the mutation spectra of BXDs with either *B* or *D* alleles at the mutator loci on chromosomes 4 and 6. Strikingly, we observed that BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci exhibited even higher C>A germline mutation rates than those with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {fig:figure-two}C). However, BXDs with *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 alone do not exhibit elevate elevated C>A mutation rates, suggesting that the effects of the chromosome 6 mutator locus depend on the presence of a *D* allele at the chromosome 4 locus (Figure {fig:figure-two}C). This result suggests the presence of epistasis between *D* alleles at the two mutator loci in the BXD.

To explore the effects of the two mutator loci in other inbred laboratory mice, we also compared the mutation spectra of Sanger Mouse Genomes Project (MGP) strains. Dumont [@PMID:30753674] previously identified private germline mutations in 29 inbred laboratory strains; these private variants likely represent recent *de novo* germline mutations. Compared to MGP strains with *B* alleles at both mutator loci, those with *D* alleles at both mutator loci exhibit significantly higher C>A germline mutation rates (Figure {@fig:figure-two}D). MGP strains with *D* alleles at both mutator loci also appear to have higher C>A mutation rates than those with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {@fig:figure-two}D), but given the smaller number of strains with *de novo* germline mutation data, we are unable to confirm the signal of epistasis using the MGP mutation data.
