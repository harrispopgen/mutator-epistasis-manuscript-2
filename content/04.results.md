### Re-identifying the mutator allele on chromosome 4 in the BXDs

We first applied our inter-haplotype distance method to 94 BXD RILs [Methods] using the previously described *de novo* germline mutation data [@PMID:35545679]. Reassuringly, we observed a large peak in cosine distance at a locus on chromosome 4 (maximum distance of X at marker ID rsYYYYY; position 116.8 Mbp in mm10 coordinates) ![
**Results of inter-haplotype distance scans in the BXD RILs.** 
a) Cosine distances between aggregate *de novo* mutation spectra on BXD haplotypes with either *D* (n = X) or *B* (n = Y) alleles at approximately 7,500 informative markers. Distance thresholds at $p = 0.2$ and $p = 0.05$ were calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD haplotype mutation data.
b) Cosine distances between aggregate *de novo* mutation spectra on BXD haplotypes with either *D* or *B* alleles at approximately 7,500 informative markers. Only BXDs with *D* haplotypes at marker rsYYYY on chromosome 4 were included in the scan. Distance thresholds at $p = 0.2$ and $p = 0.05$ were calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD haplotype mutation data.
c) Fractions of *de novo* germline mutations in BXDs with either *D* or *B* haplotypes at markers rsXXXX and rsYYYY. Total counts of each mutation type were aggregated in groups of BXDs with either of the four possible haplotype combinations, and fractions of each mutation type were calculated in each group separately. Chi-square tests of independence were used to compare counts of individual mutation types between the D-D and D-B groups of BXDs, as well as between the B-D and B-B groups. 
d) Fractions of *de novo* germline mutations in Sanger Mouse Genome Project (MGP) strains with either *D* or *B* haplotypes at markers rsXXXX and rsYYYY. Total counts of each mutation type were aggregated in groups of MGP strains with either of the four possible haplotype combinations, and fractions of each mutation type were calculated in each group separately. Chi-square tests of independence were used to compare counts of individual mutation types between the D-D and D-B groups of BXDs, as well as between the B-D and B-B groups.

In a previous analysis, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify a nearly identical locus on chromosome 4 that was significantly associated with the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. This locus overlaps 21 protein-coding genes that are annotated by the Gene Ontology as being involved in "DNA repair," but only one of these genes contains non-synonymous differences between the two parental strains: *Mutyh*. *Mutyh* encodes a protein involved in the base-excision repair of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a DNA lesion caused by oxidative damage, and prevents the accumulation of C>A mutations following DNA replication. As expected, C>A germline mutation rates are nearly 50% higher in BXDs that inherited *D* haplotypes at marker ID rsYYYY than in those that inherited *B* haplotypes.

### An additional germline mutator allele on chromosome 6

After confirming that the inter-haplotype distance method could recover the mutator locus overlapping *Mutyh*, we asked if our approach could identify additional mutator loci in the BXD. To account for the effects of the C>A germline mutator locus near *Mutyh*, we simply divided the BXD RILs into those with either *D* (n = X) or *B* (n = Y) genotypes at rsYYYYY (the peak marker on chromosome 4), and ran a genome-wide distance scan using each group separately.

Using only the BXDs with *B* haplotypes at the *Mutyh* mutator locus, we did not observe any genome-wide significant peaks. But using the BXDs with *D* haplotypes at the same locus, we identified a cosine distance peak on chromosome 6 (maximum distance of X at marker rsYYYYY; position 133.2 Mbp in mm10 coordinates). 

### Evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles

Strikingly, BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci exhibit even higher C>A germline mutation rates than those with *D* alleles at only one of the two loci. However, BXDs with *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 alone do not exhibit elevate elevated C>A mutation rates, suggesting that the effects of the chromosome 6 mutator locus depend on the presence of a *D* allele at the chromosome 4 locus.
