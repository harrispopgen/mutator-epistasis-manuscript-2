### Re-identifying the mutator allele on chromosome 4 in the BXDs

We first applied our inter-haplotype distance method to 94 BXD RILs [Methods] using the previously described *de novo* germline mutation data [@PMID:35545679]. Reassuringly, we observed a large peak in cosine distance at a locus on chromosome 4 (maximum distance of X at marker ID rsYYYYY; position 116.8 Mbp in mm10 coordinates). In a previous analysis, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify a nearly identical locus on chromosome 4 that was significantly associated with the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. This locus overlaps 21 protein-coding genes that are annotated by the Gene Ontology as being involved in "DNA repair," but only one of these genes contains non-synonymous differences between the two parental strains: *Mutyh*. *Mutyh* encodes a protein involved in the base-excision repair of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a DNA lesion caused by oxidative damage, and prevents the accumulation of C>A mutations following DNA replication. As expected, C>A germline mutation rates are nearly 50% higher in BXDs that inherited *D* haplotypes at marker ID rsYYYY than in those that inherited *B* haplotypes.

### An additional germline mutator allele on chromosome 6

After confirming that the inter-haplotype distance method could recover the mutator locus overlapping *Mutyh*, we asked if our approach could identify additional mutator loci in the BXD. To account for the effects of the C>A germline mutator locus near *Mutyh*, we simply divided the BXD RILs into those with either *D* (n = X) or *B* (n = Y) genotypes at rsYYYYY (the peak marker on chromosome 4), and re-ran a genome-wide distance scan using each group separately.

Using only the BXDs with *B* haplotypes at the *Mutyh* mutator locus, we did not observe any genome-wide significant peaks. But using the BXDs with *D* haplotypes at the same locus, we identified a cosine distance peak on chromosome 6 (maximum distance of X at marker rsYYYYY; position 133.2 Mbp in mm10 coordinates). 

### Evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles

Strikingly, BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci exhibit even higher C>A germline mutation rates than those with *D* alleles at only one of the two loci. However, BXDs with *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 alone do not exhibit elevate elevated C>A mutation rates, suggesting that the effects of the chromosome 6 mutator locus depend on the presence of a *D* allele at the chromosome 4 locus.
