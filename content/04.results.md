### Benchmarking the inter-haplotype distance method using simulations

We first tested the inter-haplotype cosine distance approach using simulated data (Materials and Methods). Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that the method's power is mostly limited by a) the initial mutation rate of the $k$-mer mutation type affected by the mutator allele and b) the total number of *de novo* germline mutations in the dataset (that is, the product of the number of haplotypes and the number of mutations per haplotype) (Figure {@fig:simulations}). For example, given 100 haplotypes with an average of 500 *de novo* germline mutations each, our method has nearly 100% power detect a mutator allele that increases the C>T *de novo* mutation rate by 10%. However, under the same conditions, the method only has about 10% power to detect a mutator that increases the C>G mutation rate, since C>G mutations are expected to make up a much smaller fraction of all *de novo* germline mutations to begin with. These simulations also demonstrate that our method is well-powered to detect large-effect mutator alleles (e.g., those that increase the mutation rate of a specific $k$-mer by 50%), even with a relatively smaller number of total mutations in the dataset.

![**Simulations to assess the power of the inter-haplotype distance method.** We simulated *de novo* germline mutations on the specified number of haplotypes, such that 50% of haplotypes were affected by a mutator allele that increased the mutation rate of the specified $k$-mer by the specified effect size (an effect size of 1.5 indicates a 50% increase in the mutation rate). The colors of the lines indicate the number of simulated mutations on each haplotype (before augmenting the mutation rate with a mutator allele). Given a specific combination of parameters, the y-axis denotes the fraction of 100 simulations in which the simulated mutator allele could be detected at a p-value of 0.05. Shaded areas indicate the standard deviation of that fraction.](images/sims.png){#fig:simulations width=7in} 

### Re-identifying the mutator allele on chromosome 4 in the BXDs

We applied our inter-haplotype distance method to 94 BXD RILs [Methods] using the previously described *de novo* germline mutation data [@PMID:35545679]. Reassuringly, we observed a large peak in cosine distance at a locus on chromosome 4 (Figure {@fig:distance-results}A; maximum distance of X at marker ID rsYYYYY; position 116.8 Mbp in mm10 coordinates).

Distance thresholds at $p = 0.2$ and $p = 0.05$ were calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD haplotype mutation data. **b)** Cosine distances between aggregate *de novo* mutation spectra on BXD haplotypes with either *D* or *B* alleles at approximately 7,500 informative markers. Only BXDs with *D* haplotypes at marker rsYYYY on chromosome 4 were included in the scan. Distance thresholds at $p = 0.2$ and $p = 0.05$ were calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD haplotype mutation data. **c)** Fractions of *de novo* germline mutations in BXDs with either *D* or *B* haplotypes at markers rsXXXX and rsYYYY. Total counts of each mutation type were aggregated in groups of BXDs with either of the four possible haplotype combinations, and fractions of each mutation type were calculated in each group separately. Chi-square tests of independence were used to compare counts of individual mutation types between the D-D and D-B groups of BXDs, as well as between the B-D and B-B groups. **d)** Fractions of *de novo* germline mutations in Sanger Mouse Genome Project (MGP) strains with either *D* or *B* haplotypes at markers rsXXXX and rsYYYY.

Chi-square tests of independence were used to compare counts of individual mutation types between the D-D and D-B groups of BXDs, as well as between the B-D and B-B groups.](images/Figure%202.png){#fig:distance-results width=7in} 

In a previous analysis, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify a nearly identical locus on chromosome 4 that was significantly associated with the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. This locus overlaps 21 protein-coding genes that are annotated by the Gene Ontology as being involved in "DNA repair," but only one of these genes contains non-synonymous differences between the two parental strains: *Mutyh*. *Mutyh* encodes a protein involved in the base-excision repair of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a DNA lesion caused by oxidative damage, and prevents the accumulation of C>A mutations following DNA replication. As expected, C>A germline mutation rates are nearly 50% higher in BXDs that inherited *D* haplotypes at marker ID rsYYYY than in those that inherited *B* haplotypes.

### An additional germline mutator allele on chromosome 6

After confirming that the inter-haplotype distance method could recover the mutator locus overlapping *Mutyh*, we asked if our approach could identify additional mutator loci in the BXD. To account for the effects of the C>A germline mutator locus near *Mutyh*, we divided the BXD RILs into those with either *D* (n = X) or *B* (n = Y) genotypes at rsYYYYY (the peak marker on chromosome 4), and ran a genome-wide distance scan using each group separately (Figure {@fig:distance-results}B.

Using only the BXDs with *B* haplotypes at the *Mutyh* mutator locus, we did not observe any genome-wide significant peaks. But using the BXDs with *D* haplotypes at the same locus, we identified a cosine distance peak on chromosome 6 (Figure {@fig:distance-results}B; maximum distance of X at marker rsYYYYY; position 133.2 Mbp in mm10 coordinates). We queried the region underneath this peak and discovered two genes annotated with the Gene Ontology term "DNA repair": *Setmar*, a protein with histone methyltransferase and transposase activity, and remarkably, *Ogg1*. The latter encodes a key member of the base-exision repair response to oxidative DNA damage, a pathway that also includes *Mutyh* and a related gene, *Mth1*. Both *Setmar* and *Ogg1* harbor nonsynonymous differences between *D* and *B* haplotypes (Table {@tbl:table-one}). 

| Gene name | Amino acid change | Position in GRCm38/mm10 coordinates |
|----------|----------|----------|
| *Ogg1* | p.Ala95Thr | chr6: |
| *Setmar* | p.Leu103Phe | chr6: |
| *Setmar* | p.Ser273Arg | chr6: |

### Evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles

We next compared the mutation spectra of BXDs with either *B* or *D* alleles at the mutator loci on chromosomes 4 and 6. Strikingly, we observed that BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci exhibited even higher C>A germline mutation rates than those with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {@fig:distance-results}C). However, BXDs with *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 alone do not exhibit elevate elevated C>A mutation rates, suggesting that the effects of the chromosome 6 mutator locus depend on the presence of a *D* allele at the chromosome 4 locus (Figure {@fig:distance-results}C). This result suggests the presence of epistasis between *D* alleles at the two mutator loci in the BXD.

To explore the effects of the two mutator loci in other inbred laboratory mice, we also compared the mutation spectra of Sanger Mouse Genomes Project (MGP) strains. Dumont [@PMID:30753674] previously identified private germline mutations in 29 inbred laboratory strains; these private variants likely represent recent *de novo* germline mutations. Compared to MGP strains with *B* alleles at both mutator loci, those with *D* alleles at both mutator loci exhibit significantly higher C>A germline mutation rates (Figure {@fig:distance-results}D). MGP strains with *D* alleles at both mutator loci also appear to have higher C>A mutation rates than those with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {@fig:distance-results}D), but given the smaller number of strains with *de novo* germline mutation data, we are unable to confirm the signal of epistasis using the MGP mutation data.
