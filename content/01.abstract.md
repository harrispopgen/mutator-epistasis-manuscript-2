## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Maintaining genome integrity in the mammalian germline is essential and enormously complex. Hundreds of proteins comprise pathways involved in DNA replication, and hundreds more are mobilized to repair DNA damage [@PMID:28485537]. While loss-of-function mutations in any of the genes encoding these proteins might lead to elevated mutation rates, *mutator alleles* have largely eluded detection in mammals. 

DNA replication and repair proteins often recognize particular sequence motifs or excise lesions at specific nucleotides. Thus, we might expect that the spectrum of de novo mutations -- i.e, the frequency of each individual mutation type (C>T, A>G, etc.) -- will differ between genomes that harbor either a mutator or wild-type allele at a given locus. Previously, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to discover a mutator allele near the DNA repair gene *Mutyh* that increases the rate of *de novo* C>A germline mutation in a collection of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) known as the BXDs [@PMID:35545679;@PMID:33472028].

In this study, we developed a new method to detect alleles that affect the mutation spectrum in biparental RILs. By applying this method to mutation data from the BXDs, we confirmed the activity of the germline mutator locus near *Mutyh*, and discovered an additional C>A germline mutator locus on chromosome 6 that overlaps *Ogg1*, a key partner of *Mutyh* in base-excision repair of oxidative DNA damage [@PMID:17581577]. Strikingly, BXDs with the mutator allele near *Ogg1* do not exhibit elevated rates of C>A germline mutation unless they also possess the mutator allele near *Mutyh*, but BXDs with both alleles exhibit even higher C>A mutation rates than those with either one alone. 

To our knowledge, these new methods for analyzing mutation spectra reveal the first evidence of epistasis between mammalian germline mutator alleles, and may be applicable to mutation data from humans and other model organisms.
