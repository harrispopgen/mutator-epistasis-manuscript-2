### Identifying *de novo* germline mutations in the BXD RILs

The BXD resource currently comprises a total of 152 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). RILs were derived from either F2 or advanced intercrosses, and subsequently inbred by brother-sister mating for up to 180 generations [@PMID:33472028]. Previously, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from the BXDs and identified candidate *de novo* germline mutations in each line [@PMID:35545679]. A detailed description of the methods used for DNA extraction, sequencing, alignment, and variant processing, as well as the characteristics of the *de novo* mutations, are available in a previous manuscript [@PMID:35545679].

Briefly, we identified private single-nucleotide mutations in each BXD that were absent from all other RILs, as well as from the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J parents. We required each private variant to be meet the following criteria: 

* genotyped as either homozygous or heterozygous for the alternate allele, with at least 90% of sequencing reads supporting the alternate allele

* supported by at least 10 sequencing reads

* Phred-scaled genotype quality of at least 20 

* must not overlap regions of the genome annotated as segmental duplications or simple repeats in GRCm38/mm10

* must occur on a parental haplotype that was inherited by at least one other BXD at the same locus; these other BXDs must be homozygous for the reference allele at the variant site

### A new approach to discover germline mutator alleles

Using the existing catalog of *de novo* germline mutations in the BXDs, we developed a new approach to discover loci that affect the germline *de novo* mutation spectrum in biparental RILs (Figure @fig:toy-diagram).

![**Overview of inter-haplotype distance method for discovering mutator alleles.** **a)** A population of four haplotypes has been genotyped at three informative markers; each haplotype also harbors private *de novo* germline mutations. At each informative marker, we compute an aggregate *de novo* germline mutation spectrum in the haplotypes that carry either parental allele, and calculate the cosine distance between the two aggregate spectra. **b)** We repeat the process outlined in a) for every informative marker along the genome. **c)** To assess the significance of any cosine distance peaks in b), we perform a permutation test by shuffling the labels associated with each haplotype's mutation data and running a genome-wide distance scan. In each of $N$ permutations, we record the maximum distance encountered at any locus in the distance scan. Finally, we calculate the $1 - p$ percentile of that maximum distance distribution to obtain a genome-wide cosine distance threshold at the specified value of $p$.](images/Figure%201.png){#fig:toy-diagram width=7in} 

We assume that a collection of haplotypes has been genotyped at informative markers, and that *de novo* germline mutations have been identified on each haplotype.

At each informative marker, we divide haplotypes into two groups based on the parental allele that they inherited. We then compute a $k$-mer mutation spectrum using the aggregate mutation counts in each haplotype group. The $k$-mer mutation spectrum contains the frequency of every possible $k$-mer mutation type in a collection of mutations, and can be represented as a vector of size $6 \times 4^{k - 1}$ after collapsing by strand complement. For example, the $1$-mer mutation spectrum is 6-element vector that contains the frequencies of C>T, C>G, C>A, A>G, A>T, and A>C mutations.

At each marker, we then calculate the cosine distance between the aggregate mutation spectra of haplotypes with either parental allele. The cosine distance between two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is defined as 

$$D_C = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{||\mathbf{A}|| \ ||\mathbf{B}||}$$

where $||\mathbf{A}||$ and $||\mathbf{B}||$ are the $L^2$ (or Euclidean) norms of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, respectively. The cosine distance metric has a number of favorable properties for comparing mutation spectra. Since cosine distance does not take the magnitude of vectors into account, it can be used to compare two spectra with unequal total mutation counts (even if those total counts are relatively small). Additionally, by calculating the cosine distance between mutation *spectra*, we avoid the need to perform separate comparisons of mutation counts at each individual $k$-mer mutation type. 

Similar to existing methods for quantitative trait locus mapping [@PMID:30591514], we use permutation tests to establish genome-wide cosine distance thresholds. In each of $N$ permutation trials, we randomly shuffle the per-haplotype mutation data such that haplotype labels no longer correspond to the correct mutation counts. Using the shuffled mutation data, we perform a genome-wide distance scan as described above, and record the maximum distance observed at any locus. After $N$ permutations (usually 10,000), we compute the $1 - p$ percentile of the maximum distance distribution, and use that percentile value as a genome-wide significance threshold (for example, at $p = 0.05$).

The inter-haplotype distance method was implemented in Python, and relies heavily on the following Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `pandera`, `seaborn`, and `numba` [@doi:https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2;@doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3509134;@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55;@url:https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v12/pedregosa11a.html;@doi:10.25080/Majora-342d178e-010;@doi:https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021;@doi:https://doi.org/10.1145/2833157.2833162].

Additional documentation is available on GitHub [@url:https://github.com/quinlan-lab/proj-mutator-mapping], along with a reproducible Snakemake [@doi:https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.29032.1] workflow for running the method from start to finish using the BXDs (including downloading the mutation data, downloading genotypes, and running a genome-wide distance scan).

### Simulations to assess the power of the inter-haplotype distance approach

We performed a series of simple simulations to estimate our power to detect alleles that affect the germline mutation spectrum in biparental RILs using the inter-haplotype distance method.

First, we simulate the $k$-mer mutation spectrum in a population of $h$ haplotypes. We assume that exactly $\frac{h}{2}$ of the haplotypes are under the effects of a mutator allele that increases the mutation rate of a particular mutation type(s) by an effect size $e$. We simulate $m$ mutations on each haplotype as follows:

We first define a vector of $1$-mer mutation probabilities:

$$P = \left( 0.4, \ 0.1, \ 0.075, \ 0.075, \ 0.075, \ 0.275 \right)$$

These probabilities sum to 1 and correspond to the expected frequencies of C>T, C>A, C>G, A>T, A>C, and A>G *de novo* germline mutations in mice, respectively [@PMID:31492841].

If we are simulating the $3$-mer mutation spectrum, we modify the vector of mutation probabilities $P$ to be length 96, and assign every 3-mer mutation type a value of $\frac{P_c}{16}$, where $P_c$ is the probability of the "central" mutation type associated with the 3-mer mutation type. In other words, each of the 16 possible N<ins>C</ins>N>N<ins>T</ins>N 3-mer mutation types would be assigned a mutation probability of $\frac{P_c}{16} = \frac{0.4}{16} = 0.025$.

To simulate the mutation spectrum on the *wild-type* haplotypes, we define a matrix $C$ of size $(\frac{h}{2}, n)$, where $n = 6 \times 4^{k - 1}$ (i.e., the number of $k$-mer mutation types being simulated). First, we generate a vector of lambda values by scaling the mutation probabilities by the number of mutations we wish to simulate:

$$\lambda = Pm$$

Then, we populate the matrix $C$ by taking a single Poisson draw from the vector of $\lambda$ values for each mutation type on each haplotype. Thus, for every row in the matrix (i.e., for every haplotype), we perform the following for the $j$th mutation type:

$$C_{*, j} = \mathrm {Pois}(\lambda_{j})$$

To simulate the mutation spectrum on the $\frac{h}{2}$ *mutator* haplotypes, we define a new matrix $C^{\prime}$ of size $(\frac{h}{2}, n)$ as defined above. We then multiply the lambda value of a particular mutation type (or multiple mutation types) by the mutator effect size $e$ to obtain $\lambda^{\prime}$. Then, for every row in the matrix:

$$C^{\prime}_{*, j} = \mathrm {Pois}(\lambda^{\prime}_{j})$$

When $k = 1$, we only augment the effect size of one mutation type at a time, but when $k = 3$, we augment a fraction (25%, 50%, or 100%) of the $3$-mer mutation types associated with a single “base” mutation type. 

After generating mutator and wild-type haplotypes, we compute the aggregate mutation spectrum in either group by summing the columns of $C$ and $C^{\prime}$. We then calculate the cosine distance between the two aggregate spectra, which we call the "focal" distance $D_f$. To determine whether $D_f$ is greater than what we'd expect by chance, we first concatenate the matrices of wild-type and mutator haplotype spectra:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
C \\
C^{\prime}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Then, in each of $N = 1,000$ trials, we randomly permute the rows of $A$. In every permutation, we consider the row indices from $\left[0, \frac{h}{2} \right)$ to correspond to the wild-type haplotypes, and the row indices from $\left[ \frac{h}{2}, h \right)$ to correspond to the mutator haplotypes. We then compute the cosine distance between the aggregate spectra of the wild-type and mutator haplotypes. If fewer than 5% of the $N$ permutations produces a cosine distance greater than or equal to $D_f$, we say that the approach succesfully identified the mutator allele. For every combination of simulation parameters ($h$, $m$, $e$, and so on) we perform 100 trials and record the number of trials in which we successfully identify the mutator allele. 

### Applying the inter-haplotype distance method to the BXDs

We downloaded previously-generated BXD *de novo* germline mutation data from the GitHub repository associated with our previous manuscript, which was also archived at Zenodo [@url:https://github.com/tomsasani/bxd_mutator_manuscript;@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5941048;@PMID:35545679], and downloaded a CSV file of BXD genotypes at 7,320 informative markers from GeneNetwork [@url:http://gn1.genenetwork.org/dbdoc/BXDGeno.html;@PMID:27933521]. We also downloaded relevant metadata about each BXD RIL from the manuscript describing the updated BXD resource [@PMID:33472028]. 

As in our previous manuscript [@PMID:35545679], we included mutation data from a subset of the 152 BXDs in our inter-haplotype distance scans. We removed any BXDs that had been inbred for fewer than 20 generations, as it takes approximately 20 generations of strict brother-sister mating for an RIL genome to become ~99.8% homozygous [@url:https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-349-04904-2]. As a result, any potential mutator allele would almost certainly be either fixed or lost after 20 generations. If fixed, the allele would remain linked to any excess mutations it causes for the duration of subsequent inbreeding, and its effects would be detectable using our methods. We also removed the BXD68 RIL from our genome-wide scans, since we previously discovered a hyper-mutator phenotype in that strain; the C>A germline mutation rate in BXD68 is over 5 times the population mean, likely due to a private deleterious nonsynonymous mutation in *Mutyh* [@PMID:35545679]. In total, we included 94 BXD RILs in our genome-wide scans.

We used Snakemake [@PMID:34035898] to write a reproducible workflow for running the inter-haplotype distance method on the BXD dataset, which has been deposited in the GitHub repository associated with this manuscript [@url:https://github.com/quinlan-lab/proj-mutator-mapping].

### Identifying candidate mutator alleles overlapping the chromosome 6 peak

We investigated the region implicated by our inter-haplotype distance approach on chromosome 6 by subsetting the joint-genotyped BXD VCF file (European Nucleotide Archive accession **PRJEB45429** [@url:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB45429]) using `bcftools` [@PMID:33590861]. To predict the functional impacts of both single-nucleotide variants and indels on splicing, protein structure, etc., we annotated variants in the BXD VCF using the following `snpEff` [@PMID:22728672] command: 

```
 java -Xmx16g -jar /path/to/snpeff/jarfile GRCm38.75 /path/to/bxd/vcf > /path/to/uncompressed/output/vcf
```

and used `cyvcf2` [@PMID:28165109] to iterate over the annotated VCF file in order to identify nonsynonymous fixed differences between the parental C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains.

### Comparing mutation spectra between Mouse Genomes Project strains

We downloaded mutation data from a previously published analysis [@PMID:30753674] (Supplementary File 1, Excel Table S3) that identified strain-private mutations in 29 strains that were originally whole-genome sequenced as part of the Sanger Mouse Genomes (MGP) project [@PMID:21921910]. When comparing counts of each mutation type between MGP strains that harbored either *D* or *B* alleles at the chromosome 4 or chromosome 6 mutator loci, we adjusted mutation counts by the number of callable A, T, C, or G nucleotides in each strain as described previously [@PMID:35545679].

### Querying GeneNetwork for evidence of eQTLs at the mutator locus

We used the online GeneNetwork resource [@PMID:27933521], which contains array- and RNA-seq-derived expression measurements in a wide variety of tissues from numerous datasets, to find *cis*-eQTLs for the DNA repair genes we implicated under the cosine distance peak on chromosome 6. On the GeneNetwork homepage (genenetwork.org), we selected the "BXD Family" **Group** and used the **Type** dropdown menu to select each of the specific expression datasets described in Table @tbl:eqtl-results. In the **Get Any** text box, we then entered the specified gene name and clicked **Search**. After selecting the appropriate data record on the next page, we used the **Mapping Tools** dropdown to run genome-wide efficient mixed model association (GEMMA) [@PMID:2453419] with the WGS-based marker genotypes and the leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) method to account for kinship between RILs. 

### Calculating the frequencies of candidate mutator alleles in wild mice 

For each of the three candidate nonsynonymous mutations we identified under the cosine distance peak on chromosome 6 (Table {@tbl:missense-diffs}), we queried a VCF file containing genome-wide variation in 67 wild-derived mice from four species of *Mus* [@PMID:27622383]. We calculated the allele frequency of each nonsynonymous mutation in each of the four species or subspecies (*Mus musculus domesticus*, *Mus musculus musculus*, *Mus musculus castaneus*, and *Mus spretus*), including genotypes that met the following criteria:

* supported by at least 10 sequencing reads 

* Phred-scaled genotype quality of at least 20
