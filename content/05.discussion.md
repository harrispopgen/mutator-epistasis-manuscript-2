### Using germline mutation spectra to identify mutator alleles

Mutation spectra can be a rich source of information about the mutational processes active in a cell or tissue, exposures to exogenous mutagens, and the life-history traits of a population [].

### Epistasis between germline mutator alleles

Our results also reveal evidence of epistasis between mammalian germline mutator alleles for the first time. BXDs with *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 only exhibit elevated C>A mutation rates if they also carry *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 4 that we identified in a previous manuscript []. However, BXDs with *D* alleles at both loci have significantly higher C>A germline mutation rates than lines with *D* alleles at only one mutator locus alone (Figure {@fig:distance-results}C). 

We observed epistasis between germline mutator alleles in an unnatural population; the BXDs were inbred by brother-sister mating in a highly controlled laboratory environment that attenuated the effects of natural selection on all but the most deleterious alleles. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that epistasis could contribute to the evolution of germline mutation rates and spectra in natural populations. When we queried wild mouse genomes for for the three nonsynonymous DNA repair mutations overlapping the chromosome 6 mutator locus, we found all three at high frequency in *Mus mus domesticus*, the strain from which C57BL/6J and DBA/2J derive most of their genomes. Since the *D* mutator haplotype on chromosome 6 does not appear to increase the C>A germline mutation rate on its own (even in a homozygous state), we hypothesize that similar alleles may be at intermediate or high frequency in other natural populations. Moreover, if these alleles only exert an effect on the germline mutation rate if paired with another unlinked mutator allele, it may be challenging for both alleles to be purged by natural selection.
