### Using germline mutation spectra to identify mutator alleles

Germline mutation spectra are a rich source of information about the demographic history of populations, as well as the activity of both exogenous and endogenous sources of mutation throughout time. For example, by analyzing the $3$-mer mutation spectrum in a collection of human genomes, Harris and Pritchard [@PMID:28440220] discovered a "pulse" of TCC>TTC mutation activity in European populations that likely occurred between 15,000 and 2,000 years ago, and perhaps began even earlier [@PMID:34016747]).

Within somatic tissues, mutation spectra can also be used to uncover the mutational processes active in particular populations of cells [@PMID:23945592]. New computational methods have been developed to extract "mutational signatures" from large databases of somatic mutations in cancer [@PMID:36388765]. These signatures, which describe the relative frequency of each $3$-mer mutation type, can often be precisely attributed to chemotherapeutic agents, exposures to environmental mutagens, or loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding DNA repair or replication proteins [@PMID:23945592;@PMID:31740835;@PMID:27811275]. 

Although a germline mutator allele should increase the absolute count of mutations on a linked haplotype, our results demonstrate that its effects can be more easily detectable by examining mutation *spectra* instead. For example, *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 augment the C>A mutation rate by a factor of approximately 1.2 (Figure {@fig:distance-results}). Since C>A mutations comprise approximately 10% of all germline mutations to begin with, *D* alleles only increase the overall germline mutation rate by about 2%. Given the depth of information that can be encoded in the mutation spectrum, we expect that mutation spectra can be further exploited to discover genetic modifiers of the mutation rate in other study systems, as well. 

### Epistasis between germline mutator alleles

Our results also reveal evidence of epistasis between mammalian germline mutator alleles for the first time. BXDs with *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 6 only exhibit elevated C>A mutation rates if they also carry *D* alleles at the previously-identified [@PMID:35545679] mutator locus on chromosome 4. And BXDs with *D* alleles at both loci have significantly higher C>A germline mutation rates than lines with *D* alleles at only one mutator locus alone (Figure {@fig:distance-results}C). This raises the exciting possibility that epistasis between mutator alleles has contributed to the evolution of germline mutation rates and spectra in mammalian genomes.

Importantly, we note that we observed epistasis between germline mutator alleles in an unnatural population; the BXDs were inbred by brother-sister mating in a highly controlled laboratory environment that attenuated the effects of natural selection on all but the most deleterious alleles [@doi:10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173437]. Howver, we found the *D* allele in *Ogg1* to be at nearly 25% frequency in *Mus musculus domesticus*, the strain from which C57BL/6J and DBA/2J derive most of their genomes [@PMID:17660819]. Since the *D* mutator haplotype on chromosome 6 does not appear to increase the C>A germline mutation rate on its own (even in a homozygous state), we hypothesize that similar alleles may be at intermediate or high frequency in other natural populations. 

### Causal variants underlying the mutator allele

Only one DNA repair gene overlapping the C>A mutator locus on chromosome 6 also contained nonsynonymous fixed differences between the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J founder strains: *Ogg1*, a protein-coding gene that participates in base-excision repair of the oxidative DNA lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) [@PMID:17581577]. Both missense mutations and loss-of-heterozygosity in *Ogg1* have been associated with initiation and progression of various types of human cancer [@PMID:22829015;@PMID:10987279;@PMID:9662341]. Unrepaired 8-oxoG lesions can also lead to C>A mutations, and copy-number losses of either *Ogg1* or *Mutyh* are linked to elevated rates of spontaneous C>A mutation in human neuroblastoma [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2007898118]. Given these various lines of evidence, we believe that *Ogg1* is the most likely candidate gene to explain the additional C>A mutator phenotype in the BXDs, but it remains unclear whether the p.Thr95Ala missense mutation is the causal allele. We hypothesized that *Mutyh* missense mutations on *D* haplotypes were responsible for the large-effect C>A mutator phenotype we previously observed in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. However, using high-quality long-read assemblies of inbred laboratory strains, another group recently identified a ~5 kbp mobile element insertion (MEI) within the first intron of *Mutyh* [@doi:10.1101/2022.09.26.509577] that is present on *D* haplotypes and absent from *B* haplotypes. The MEI is associated with significantly reduced expression of *Mutyh* in embryonic stem cells from laboratory strains, and may therefore underlie the previous C>A germline mutator phenotype in the BXDs. In light of this new evidence, we cannot discount the possibility that eQTLs associated with decreased expression of *Ogg1* (Table @tbl:eqtl-results) are responsible for the C>A mutator phenotype we observed in this study.

### Discovering mutator alleles in other systems

Numerous lines of evidence suggest that mutator alleles contribute to variation in mutation rates and spectra across the tree of life. In two natural isolates of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, nonsynonymous variation in *OGG1* causes a substantial increase in the C>A *de novo* mutation rate [@PMID:34523420]. A recent analysis suggested that mutator alleles and/or environmental mutagens have shaped mutation rate evolution in human genomes [@doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.17.496622], and more generally, the mutation spectrum has evolved rapidly during great ape evolution, potentially due to the effects of *trans*-acting mutation rate modifiers [@PMID:33983415]. The heritability of paternal *de novo* mutation counts in the human germline has also been estimated to be between 10 and 20%, demonstrating a contribution of genetic factors to germline mutation rates [@doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.17.520885]). However, mutator discovery remains challenging in mammalian genomes.

What conditions must be met in order to detect a germline mutator allele? Presumably, one must have access to many haplotypes, each with a reasonably large number of *de novo* germline mutations that remain linked to the mutator allele(s) that caused them. Recently, thousands of human pedigrees have been sequenced in an effort to precisely estimate the rate of human *de novo* germline mutation [@PMID:31549960;@PMID:28959963]. Selection on germline mutator alleles will likely prevent large-effect mutators from reaching high allele frequencies; however, if multiple mutators are active in a particular population, it becomes much more likely that a subset will be detectable by sequencing human trios [@PMID:35666194]. Current estimates of power to detect germline mutators in human pedigrees generally assume that mutators affect all mutation types equally, and that methods for mutator discovery will rely on identifying haplotypes with excess total mutation counts [@PMID:35666194]. However, our results in the BXD suggest that germline mutators often exert their effects on a small number of $k$-mer mutation types, and may be far more amenable to detection by analyzing mutation spectra instead.
