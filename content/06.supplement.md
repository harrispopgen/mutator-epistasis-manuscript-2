**Simulations to assess the power of the inter-haplotype distance method.** 
In each of 100 trials, we simulated genotypes at 1,000 biallelic loci on a toy population of either 50 or 100 haplotypes as follows.
At every locus on every haplotype, we drew a single floating point value from a uniform distribution ($[0, 1)$).
If that value was less than or equal to 0.5, we set the allele to be "A"; otherwise, we set the allele to be "B".
In each trial, we also simulated *de novo* germline mutations on the population of haplotypes, such that at a single locus $g_i$, we augmented the mutation rate of a particular $k$-mer by the specified effect size (an effect size of 1.5 indicates a 50% increase in the mutation rate) on haplotypes carrying "A" alleles.
We then applied the inter-haplotype distance method to these simulated data and asked if the adjusted cosine distance at locus $g_i$ was greater than expected by chance. 
Given a specific combination of parameters, the y-axis denotes the fraction of 100 trials in which the simulated mutator allele could be detected at a significance threshold of p = 0.05.
Shaded areas indicate the standard deviation of that fraction across 100 simulations.

**Comparing power between the inter-haplotype distance method and QTL mapping.** 
In each of 100 trials, we simulated genotypes at 1,000 biallelic loci on a toy population of 100 haplotypes as follows.
At every locus on every haplotype, we drew a single floating point value from a uniform distribution ($[0, 1)$).
If that value was less than or equal to 0.5, we set the allele to be "A"; otherwise, we set the allele to be "B".
In each trial, we also simulated *de novo* germline mutations on the population of haplotypes, such that at a single locus $g_i$, we augmented the rate of the specified mutation type by the specified effect size (an effect size of 1.5 indicates a 50% increase in the mutation rate) on haplotypes carrying "A" alleles.
We then applied the inter-haplotype distance method to these simulated data and asked if the adjusted cosine distance at locus $g_i$ was greater than expected by chance. 
Similarly, in each trial, we used R/qtl2 to perform a genome scan for QTL and asked if the log-odds score at $g_i$ was greater than expected by chance.
Given a specific combination of parameters, the y-axis denotes the fraction of 100 trials in which the simulated mutator allele could be detected at a significance threshold of p = 0.05 (for IHD) or at an alpha of $\frac{0.05}{7}$ (for QTL mapping).
Shaded areas indicate the standard deviation of that fraction across 100 simulations.

**Quantative trait locus scans for mutation spectrum phenotypes.**
Using the BXDs with *D* genotypes at `rs52263933` (the marker with the highest cosine distance on chromosome 4), we used R/qtl2 to perform QTL scans for the fraction of each 1-mer mutation type.
Plots show the log-odds (LOD) score at every genotyped marker in blue; the dotted black line represents the genome-wide LOD significance threshold (established using 1,000 permutations at an alpha of $\frac{0.05}{7}$ to account for the fact that 7 separate association tests were performed.)
