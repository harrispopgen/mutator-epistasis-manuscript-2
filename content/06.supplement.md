### Using cosine distance instead of $\chi^2$ statistics for comparing mutation spectra

We also explored the use of cosine distance as an alternative to the $\chi^{2}$ statistic for comparing mutation spectra in our inter-haplotype distance scans. The cosine distance between two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is defined as 

$$D_C = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{||\mathbf{A}|| \ ||\mathbf{B}||}$$

where $||\mathbf{A}||$ and $||\mathbf{B}||$ are the $L^2$ (or Euclidean) norms of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, respectively. The cosine distance metric has a number of favorable properties for comparing mutation spectra. Since cosine distance does not take the magnitude of vectors into account, it can be used to compare two spectra with unequal total mutation counts (even if those total counts are relatively small). Additionally, by calculating the cosine distance between mutation *spectra*, we avoid the need to perform separate comparisons of mutation counts at each individual $k$-mer mutation type. 

In practice, we found that the $\chi^2$ statistic was more sensitive for detecting loci associated with differences in mutation spectra. However, we provide the ability to use cosine distance in our method, as well, since the $\chi^2$ statistic may not behave as expected in certain situations (e.g., if the counts of mutations in each $k$-mer type are small).
